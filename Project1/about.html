        We briefly saw the use of the inter-process communication (IPC) module as one solution for having contextual menus in our application. In this chapter, we are going to explore this module in greater depth. Now, this is not the most glamorous part of API,
        but it is certainly the workhorse that much of our real-world applications will rely upon. Getting Started Since Electron applications are broken into two separate processes (main and render), we need a system to communicate between them. That
        system is in the IPC module. This module allows you to send and receive synchronous and asynchronous messages between the processes. Each process has a specific module: ipcRenderer and ipcMain (Figure 6-1).
