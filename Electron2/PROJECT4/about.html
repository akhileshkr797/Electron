        Well, that wasn’t in any way exciting. The only output we are seeing is webContents []. Of course, we have done this on purpose so that we can show you that this early in the application startup process, webContents is an empty array. In other words,
        we won’t see anything inside this array until we add a BrowserWindow object to the screen. Let’s do that now. At the bottom of the createWindow function, add the console log seen at here at the bottom of the createWindow method to your code.
